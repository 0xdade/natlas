Natlas
========

You've got a lot of maps and they are getting pretty unruly. What do you do? You put them in a book and call it an atlas. This is like that, except it's a website and it's a collection of nmaps. Originally forked from [pierce403/nweb](https://github.com/pierce403/nweb).

natlas-server
-------
The natlas-server is where the data gets stored and the web interface exists so that you can search through the data.

You can read more about setting up and running the server on the [natlas-server/README.md](natlas-server/README.md)


natlas-agent
-------
The natlas-agent is what fetches work from the server and actually performs the scans.

You can read more about setting up and running the agent on the [natlas-agent/README.md](natlas-agent/README.md)
